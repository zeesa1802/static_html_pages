          <strong style="text-decoration: underline">Adobe Photoshop</strong> is
          a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for
          macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John
          Knoll. Since then, it has become the de facto industry standard in
          raster graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a
          verb as in "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop
          contest", though Adobe discourages such use.
